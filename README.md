# js-hangman
This is an implementation of traditional Hangman game.
The website randomly chooses a word from a pool of 999 words.
User has to guess the letters in the word one by one, if user guesses the right letter, all occurances of that letter in the word are displayed, if not the user's amount of guesses is reduced by 1 (initially 10 guesses are available).
If a user wins or loose, a alert with the specified message is displayed and the game refreshes.
If user feels stuck on a word, he can get a hint(meaning of that word) by clicking on 'Get Hint' button, but the downfall is the number of guesses is reduced by 1.
You can play the game at https://sahilgore0204.github.io/js-hangman/
